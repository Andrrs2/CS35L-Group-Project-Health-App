# CS35L-Group-Project-Health-App

# Overall Project Idea
Our group plans to create a health tracker web app that holds information about the clients health status, including workouts, recommended calorie intake, sleep schedules, and weight graphs. We chose to create a health tracker app because it would give us a lot of options for features. There are many different aspects of peoplesâ€™ health that we could implement, so it gives us a lot of flexibility.
